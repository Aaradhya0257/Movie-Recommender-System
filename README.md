Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** developed using Python and various machine learning libraries. The system provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences, utilizing collaborative filtering. By analyzing user data and movie features, it predicts the films that users are most likely to enjoy, enhancing their movie-watching experience.

## Features

- Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user-user or item-item similarities, leveraging historical user interactions.
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, normalization, and transformation for accurate model training.
- Performance Evaluation: Uses metrics like cosine similarity for recommendation quality.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms for building the recommendation models.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations for matrix handling.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization for insights into user preferences and model performance.
